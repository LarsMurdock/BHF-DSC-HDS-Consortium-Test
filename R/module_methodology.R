    There are some limitations of this definition as outlined below:
    <ul>
  <li>Variables that take text values such as “9. Unknown” will be classed as complete, which will result in the completeness plot showing a higher proportion of complete records than would be generally useable in research. Similarly, code terminology fields (ICD-10, SNOMED-CT,…) can contain codes that don’t provide meaningful information (e.g. ICD10 code: R69 – “Unknown and unspecified causes of morbidity”). An ICD10 code field populated with this code would be classed as complete.</li>
  <li>Some fields we would not expect to be 100% complete, as they are only eligible to be complete under certain circumstances. For example, for Year of Death in primary care data the completeness is calculated as a % of all records, not just records for deceased patients. Similarly, a field that can only be completed when an earlier field takes a specific value (e.g., in NICOR MINAP dataset, REFERRING_HOSPITAL will only be available if ADMISSION_METHOD takes value “4. Inter-hospital transfer for specific treatment”) may result in the completeness plot showing a much lower proportion of complete records for this particular field because completeness has been calculated with reference to the total number of records, rather than the subset of records that are applicable in this case. </li>

  </ul>

  It is worth noting that completeness is calculated at a record level, rather than patient level. It might be possible to obtain a higher proportion of completeness for a given variable at a patient level, by looking across all patient records in the dataset.
<br><br>
Similarly, completeness for an individual variable in a dataset might be lower than what can be achieved through the harmonisation and linkage of multiple datasets. For example, projects making use of linked data generally derive patient characteristics such as Age, Gender, and Ethnicity from multiple sources rather than an individual dataset to maximise completeness.
