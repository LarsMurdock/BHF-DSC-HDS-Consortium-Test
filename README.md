# BHF Data Science Centre TRE Exploration Dashboard

Accredited researchers, working on one or more of the consortiumâ€™s approved projects, can access routinely collected datasets across the whole population of the UK within secure trusted research environments (TREs) provided by NHS Digital in England, the National Data Safe Haven in Scotland, the SAIL Databank in Wales and the Honest Broker Service in Northern Ireland.

Linkable datasets include those from primary and secondary care, COVID lab tests and vaccinations, deaths, critical care, prescribing/dispensing, cardiovascular and stroke audits, maternity services and mental health.

This dashboard exists to allow exploration of the datasets available to the consortium in the respective TREs.
